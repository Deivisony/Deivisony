### 📌 About Me

I'm an IT Technician at **a government office**, where I orchestrate hardware repairs and provide hands-on support. My journey started with a curiosity for "what's inside the box," and now I'm channeling that same energy into understanding the architecture of software systems.

My goal is to transition from fixing machines to building intelligent systems. I'm currently diving deep into **C, Linux, and System Design**, with a vision to create **AI-powered tools** that streamline decision-making and automate complex tasks.

- 🏢 **Currently:** Resolving support calls and performing hardware maintenance.
- 🌱 **Learning:** C, Python, Bash, Docker, and the art of System Design.
- 🎯 **Goal:** To become a DevOps or AI Engineer.
- 🤝 **Open to:** Collaborating on open-source automation, AI, or DevOps projects.

### ✨ Fun Facts

- 🛠️ My approach to technology is like studying a language's etymology: I trace systems back to their foundational concepts to understand their evolution and the 'why' behind their design.
- 🐧 Gradually migrating my digital life from Windows to the open-source world of Linux.
- 🧠 I'm building a "Second Brain" using **Notion & Obsidian** with the Zettelkasten method. It's my personal OS for life!
- 🎲 When I'm not coding, I'm probably min-maxing a DnD character for the perfect build. It's just logic training in disguise! 🧙‍♂️
- 🚀 My ultimate dream? Research at a place like **MIT** or build an AI that genuinely helps people.
